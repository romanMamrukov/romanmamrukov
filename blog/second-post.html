    <h1>Personal website from idea to a million iterations</h1>
    <p>The story of my personal website goes all the way back to 2014. Back then, I was studying a Games Development
      course and didn’t want to be the only one among my fellow programmer classmates without a personal page. The first
      version was simple — just enough to have an online presence and a place to link to my projects.</p>
    <p>As time went on, my goals expanded. I wanted the site not only to showcase my work but also to help me attract
      clients for website development and possibly land job opportunities. Around 2015–2016, I decided to experiment
      with self-hosting on a small nettop computer using Apache and PHP. For a while, it was a fun setup — running from
      my own home — until I had to move, and the website project was set aside for a few years.</p>
    <p>In 2020, I revived the site with a simpler, more modern look, this time focusing on making it clean, easy to
      navigate, and a better representation of my skills. Then, starting in 2024 and continuing into 2025, I began
      iterating more frequently, adding new features, improving performance, and experimenting with the design. Each
      update was a learning opportunity — from responsive layouts to better SEO structure and accessibility tweaks.</p>
    <p>Today, the site stands in what I’d call its “semi-final” form. I’m happy with how it looks and functions, though
      I know there will always be small improvements to make. That’s the beauty of a personal website: it’s never truly
      finished. It grows and evolves alongside my own skills, ideas, and ambitions.</p>
